## ‚úÖ What You'll Need

1. **Snowflake Account Identifier**
    
    You can find this in your account settings:
    
    <img 
      src="/public/images/snowflake-integration/snowflake-account-id.png" 
      alt="Snowflake Account ID 1"
      className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg my-4"
    />
    
    <img 
      src="/public/images/snowflake-integration/snowflake-account-id2.png" 
      alt="Snowflake Account ID 2"
      className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg my-4"
    />

2. **Snowflake Username**
    
    You can use your existing user, or create a dedicated service user:
    
    ### Optional: Create a Dedicated Service User
    
    Run this SQL in your Snowflake UI:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE USER hunch_service_user
    DEFAULT_ROLE = HUNCH_ANALYST
    DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = COMPUTE_WH
    TYPE = SERVICE;
    ```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Step 1: Set Up the Role and Permissions

Make sure Hunch has access to the data you want it to analyze. Run the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS HUNCH_ANALYST;

GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA {database}.{schema} TO ROLE HUNCH_ANALYST;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE {database} TO ROLE HUNCH_ANALYST;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA {database}.{schema} TO ROLE HUNCH_ANALYST;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE {warehouse} TO ROLE HUNCH_ANALYST;

GRANT ROLE HUNCH_ANALYST TO USER {your_username_or_service_user};
```

Replace `{database}`, `{schema}`, and `{warehouse}` and `{your_username_or_service_user}` with your actual values.

---

## üîê Step 2: Generate a Private/Public Key Pair

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out private_key.pem -nocrypt
openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
cat public_key.pem
```

- This will generate two files:
    - `private_key.pem` ‚Üí **Keep this secure! You'll upload it to Hunch.**
    - `public_key.pem` ‚Üí Copy the cleaned output (as one line).

---

## üîÅ Step 3: Add Public Key to Snowflake User

Paste the public key into this Snowflake SQL command:

```sql
ALTER USER {your_username_or_service_user}
SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY={your-public-key};
```

---

## üßæ Step 4: Get the Fingerprint

Run this in Snowflake to get the fingerprint of your uploaded public key:

```sql
DESCRIBE USER {your_username_or_service_user};
```

Find the value under `RSA_PUBLIC_KEY_FP`

  alt="Snowflake RSA Fingerprint"
  className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg my-4"
/>

---

## üß© Step 5: Fill the Form in Hunch

Now that you have:

- ‚úÖ Snowflake Account Identifier
- ‚úÖ Username (or service user)
- ‚úÖ Private key (from Step 2)
- ‚úÖ RSA Public Key Fingerprint (from Step 4)

Fill in these details in the Hunch integration form:

<img 
  src="/public/images/snowflake-integration/snowflake-form.png" 
  alt="Snowflake Form"
  className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg my-4"
/>

---

## üìù Step 6: Enter Your Warehouse, Database, and Schema

In the final step, enter your Warehouse Name, Database Name, and Schema Name in the configuration form as shown below:

  src="/public/images/snowflake-integration/snowflake-config.png" 
  alt="Snowflake Configuration Form"
  className="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg my-4"
/>

## üîí A note on security

> **Security Note**: Hunch uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication with RSA key pairs, which is Snowflake's recommended method for secure third-party integrations. This approach ensures that no passwords are stored and provides strong cryptographic security for the connection.
