# Quickstart

> **TL;DR** — Connect data → start a chat → get answers.

1. **Connect your data**  
   Head to the **[Integrations](/pages/integrations)** page and pick a source. Complete OAuth or drop in keys and you're good.

2. **Start a chat**  
   Open the Hunch platform, click **New Chat**, and ask your first question (e.g. "Why are users churning after onboarding?").

3. **Need depth? Tap Deep‑research**  
   Hunch spins up a **playbook** that runs a full investigation.

### Playbooks at a glance

- **Scope** – the question you're tackling.
- **Data findings** – tables, events, and segments Hunch pulls automatically.
- **Metrics & queries** – generated (and editable) SQL that powers the analysis.
- **Conclusion & next steps** – a concise narrative plus action items.

### Transparent Analysis

Every analysis in Hunch is fully transparent. You can:

- View all SQL queries generated during the analysis
- Edit queries to adjust the analysis
- Export queries to run them directly in your data warehouse
- Track the full analysis process in the query log

You can reopen a playbook any time or share it with the team so nobody has to rediscover the same insight twice.
